A USSD powered banking app for android<br>
As fintech startups keep popping up everywhere, I always wonder if it’s that easy to build a payments app of any kind.  I want to see if I can really work on a project for that long. I will be using the 6 stages of software development: planning, analysis, design, implementation/development, testing/integration, and maintenance.<br>

USSD – unstructured supplementary service data. It sounds a bit complicated, and can get technical very quickly, but for the purposes of financial inclusion, there are two key things to understand. First, when you dial a number that starts with * and ends with #, you are using USSD. Second, USSD is currently the best available communications technology to deliver mobile financial services to low-income customers.<br>
